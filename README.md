# Shadcn with Promise Dialogs

This project is a demo on how to use Shadcn's dialogs like promises.
Using a dialog in a promise manner is something that is very useful and
it can make an awesome DX and maybe improve your code quality.

To make things easier this project is using Zustand, but you could adapt
the idea to pretty much anything, even React Context probably.

## Run the project

```bash
bun i
bun dev
```
